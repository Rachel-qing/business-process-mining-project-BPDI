# Business Process Mining (BPDI) Project

This project focuses on optimizing a customer onboarding and fraud detection process in a financial service scenario, covering the full lifecycle of:

Process Modeling → Simulation → Optimization → Process Mining

Goal: Improve process efficiency and throughput under zero additional resource constraints using data-driven methods.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project simulates a real-world enterprise transition from a **manual As-Is process** to an **automated To-Be process**, integrating data services and process optimization techniques.

---

## 🧩 Module 1 — As-Is Process Modeling

**Goal:** Formalize the current process into a structured and analyzable model  

- Modeled the full BPMN workflow, including normal and cancellation scenarios (`as-is-model-full.drawio`)  
- Structured the process into a block-structured version to ensure correctness (`as-is-model-basic-block-structured.drawio`)  
- Generated a process tree for formal validation using PM4Py (`as-is-model-basic-tree.ipynb`)  

---

## ⚙️ Module 2 — Simulation & Process Redesign

**Goal:** Identify bottlenecks and improve process performance through simulation  

- Built Petri net models and verified correctness via reachability analysis (`as-is.pnml`, `as-is-reachability-graph.drawio`)  
- Performed model-based and data-based simulation using WoPeD (`q1.docx`, `q2.docx`)  
- Generated event logs and analyzed performance improvements (`as-is.xes`, `q2.xes`, `analysis.docx`)  
- Designed an optimized process via resource reallocation (`to-be.pnml`)  

---

## 🔁 Module 3 — BPMN Modeling & Tool Evaluation

**Goal:** Implement and validate the redesigned process using BPMN tools  

- Designed the To-Be BPMN model with automation and system integration (`to-be-model-full.bpmn`)  
- Simulated process execution using BIMP (`BIMP.docx`)  
- Evaluated tool capabilities and workflow pattern support using Trisotech (`Trisotech.docx`)  

---

## 🔍 Module 4 — Process Mining & Analysis

**Goal:** Analyze process behavior and validate improvements using event data  

- Discovered process models using multiple mining algorithms (Alpha, Inductive, Heuristic) (`ProjectReport.pdf`)  
- Analyzed bottlenecks using performance spectrum and dotted charts (`ProjectReport.pdf`)  
- Evaluated resource allocation and collaboration patterns (`logs/*.xes`)  

---

## 🚀 Key Results
- 📈 Throughput improvement: 150 → 210 cases/month (+40%)
- ⚙️ Zero additional resources (pure process optimization)
- 🔍 Identified core bottleneck: Fraud Review stage
- 🔄 Improvements validated via simulation + process mining
